* Set up devlog
* First round of code reviews for:
  * Fight
  * Buy
  * Sell
  * Check masteries
  * Deposit gold
  * Enchant items
  * Move
  * Level up
  * Locate player
  * Rank up
  * Reincarnate
  * Revive
  * Teleport
  * Transfer gold
  * Withdraw gold

Made decision that gold should be treated as an inventory item. Banks should
act as inventories in code, with the ability to filter what types of items
can be deposited (just gold for now.) Some items (like gold) will be stackable
which allows for item-based quests. Inventories can contain inventories to
allow subdivision of inventory.
